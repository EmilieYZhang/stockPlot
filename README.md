>Note:
>you have many options as tools to plot stuff: 1. plotly tried a 3D model with this
https://plotly.com/python/3d-charts/
>or 2. Bokeh which is what i have been using mostly
https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html
>or any other python plotting library: matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

& yes, our frontend which uses streamlit can seemingly accept plots from most libraries to display
