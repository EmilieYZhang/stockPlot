1. clone this locally
2. In the terminal; execute: pip install streamlit --upgrade
3. then, do: streamlit run 1_Overview.py
4. see if you get something like this

>TODO:
pls help make any kind of graph you can think of that might show anomalies with the json data they gave us
>you have 2 options as tools to plot stuff: 1. plotly (very common, maybe try a 3D model? that would be very cool)
https://plotly.com/python/3d-charts/
>or 2. Bokeh which is what i have been using so far (not much variety tbh, but up to you)
https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html

& yes, our frontend which uses streamlit can accept plots from either libraries to display so it should be ok although i havent tested plotly yet
